A long time ago, developers used to pride themselves on being back-end developers. Today we have tools like the Cloud, Docker, and many APIs. If you're starting a company today, there's a good chance you'll do the majority of your development on the front end with Javascript. The next thing we'll look at is template literals, which we've already been using in the code. Instead of concatenating values together, we can actually interpolate them directly into the string. This tends to be the better way to go if you have multiple objects to destructure in a single function. Modern JavaScript can reduce the number of lines that change when you do git commit. to use the spread syntax on arrays. If we want to take an array and then have it accumulate to a value that equals, say, a total amount, we can use array reduce. Mapping and filtering values is even easier. Async await allows us to express asynchronous code in a synchronous format. We can use a wait in front of our promises, and have them resolve to an actual variable value. Async await is one of the most awesome things to ever happen to JavaScript.
