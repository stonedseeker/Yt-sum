A few years ago, I broke into my own house. It was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter. I broke through the basement window, cleared out the shards of glass. I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the whole opening. And it wasn't until I got to the airport, check-in counter, that I realized I didn't have my passport. When you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol. Cortisol is toxic and it causes cloudy thinking. If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it, your things will always be there when you look for them. Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards, your driver's license, your passport, mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud. If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement. You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped. For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50, removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 49. 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped. The idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward.
