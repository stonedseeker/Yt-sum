CNN's John Sutter has created an AI system that can be taught to think. Sutter used a technique called few shot prompting to teach the large language model to follow a pattern. When a model can do this, they're called reasoning models. And they're powerful. With problem solving, especially complex problems, the first idea isn't always best. It can go down one path and go, oh, dead end. When you're struggling with AI, it's not the AI's fault. It's that you don't really yet know how to think clearly. The AI can only be as clear as you are.
