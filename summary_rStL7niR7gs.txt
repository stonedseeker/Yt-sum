The power of a king is not to act but to get others to act on his behalf using the treasure in his vaults. A king can't build roads alone, can't enforce laws alone and can't defend the nation or himself alone. All the changes you wish to make are but thoughts in your head if the keys will not follow your commands. After a coup, the new dictator will purge some of those who helped him come to power. But the keys necessary to gain power are not the same as those needed to keep it. A dictator that sues the right keys and cuts unnecessary spending will have a long and successful career. In a democracy, the more productivity the better, writes Julian Zelizer. The worst dictators are those whose incentives are aligned with the fewest citizens, he says. Zelizer: The best smartest democracies are stable, the worst richest dictatorships are stable. In a democracy most already have these things, so why risk it? The more the wealth of a nation comes from the productive citizens of the nation, the more the power gets spread out. If a stable democracy becomes very poor or if a resource that dwarfs the productivity of the citizens is found, the odds of this gamble change.
